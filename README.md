# Dungeon Crawler (Pygame-ce Prototype)

Basic top-down, tile-based dungeon crawler scaffold built with Python and Pygame-ce.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the game

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see a small dungeon room and a yellow player square that
can be moved around using **WASD**, colliding with the walls.
